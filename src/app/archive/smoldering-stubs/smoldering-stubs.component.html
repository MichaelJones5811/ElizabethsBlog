<p>&ldquo;If you do not stand firm in your faith, you will not stand at all.&rdquo;<br />Do not lose heart because of these two smoldering stubs of firewood.<br />It will not take place. It will not happen. For the King of Eternity has <br />covered you.<br />God you are the only one that exist in power, knowledge, and wisdom. <br />The sky is a reflection of your beauty. Who compares to you? <br />No one, nothing.<br />Only you can shatter the shackles that bind to sin.<br />Oh Great and Mighty King, to live to please you, I have a special request.</p>
<p>May you hear and understand what the Lord speaks into your life. <br />May you have discernment and wisdom when he opens your eyes to the obstacles that separate you from Him. <br />May your heart soften, so you may humbly, approach the Most High God for healing.<br />May your home be secure and filled with truth. <br />May it continuously grow in peace, joy, and love.<br />Until the return of Jesus, you will stand firm in your faith and see the right hand of the Lord move on your behalf.<br />May all this be true so the whole world will see that your God is a Mighty King.<br />In Jesus name I pray. Amen and Amen</p>
